# flask_api

A tiny Flask REST API for key-value storage. **No DB branch**.

You can switch between branches to change key-value storage flavour.

## Quick start

Deploy containers using:

```shell
docker compose up
```

Go to http://localhost:8000 to fiddle with Swagger UI.

Go to http://localhost:8000/keys_page/ to see all current keys and values.
